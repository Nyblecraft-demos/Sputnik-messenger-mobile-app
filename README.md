Security and privacy
To protect user data and ensure the privacy of correspondence, the initial version of the Sputnik-1 messenger uses the end-to-end encryption system E3Kit by Virgil Security. This company has proven itself in the development of multiple cryptographic solutions for both individual developers and businesses. All Virgil Security SDKs are open and available for use

Asymmetric encryption. Each user is provided with a private and public key, which enables the data security by end-to-end encryption.
Sputnik grants an opportunity to access the system through multiple devices on iOS/Android/web browsers while using the single private decryption key.
Encryption and decryption of data are done on the client-side. Thus, your data cannot be intercepted by anyone, including hackers, third-party developers and members of internal teams.
The private key can be restored through the verification system via secret questions and answers
Data signature and verification takes place within encryption and decryption functions. The data originates from the user that has encrypted it, and it can not be altered in transit or storage.
We note that the E3Kit system is a temporary solution. We are currently developing our own SDK for end-to-end encryption.
